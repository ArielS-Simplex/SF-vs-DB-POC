# Simple Databricks → Snowflake POC

**Goal**: Take your Databricks scripts and refactor them to equivalent Snowflake scripts that do exactly the same thing.

## How This Works:

1. **You**: Put your Databricks scripts in `databricks/original_scripts/` ✅ **DONE**
2. **Me**: I'll analyze them and create Snowflake equivalents in `snowflake/refactored_scripts/` ✅ **COMPLETE**
3. **You**: Run both versions and compare results 🔄 **READY FOR TESTING**

## ✅ **REFACTORING COMPLETE!**

### **Databricks → Snowflake Equivalents Created:**

| Databricks Original | Snowflake Equivalent | What It Does |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| `silver_batch_etl.ipynb` | `silver_batch_etl.sql` | Main bronze-to-silver ETL pipeline |
| `data_utility_modules.ipynb` | `data_utility_functions.sql` | Metadata management (SchemaManager) |
| `custom_etl_functions.ipynb` | `custom_etl_functions.sql` | Transaction transformations & data type fixes |
| **ALL COMBINED** | `complete_etl_execution.sql` | **Single script that does everything** |

### **🎯 Ready for Apple-to-Apple Testing:**

**For you to test:**
1. Run your Databricks notebook with a specific `TARGET_TABLE`
2. Run the Snowflake `complete_etl_execution.sql` with the same data  
3. Compare the results - they should be **identical**

### **Key Features Preserved:**
- ✅ Exact same business logic transformations
- ✅ Same data type conversions and cleaning
- ✅ Same test client filtering  
- ✅ Same boolean field handling
- ✅ Same checkpoint/metadata management
- ✅ Same merge/upsert logic

## Folder Structure:
```
databricks/original_scripts/    ← Your Databricks scripts ✅
snowflake/refactored_scripts/   ← Snowflake versions ✅ COMPLETE
```

**🚀 READY TO TEST**: Run both versions and compare results!
