# Databricks to Snowflake ETL Project - Handoff Prompt

## Project Context
I'm working on achieving parity between Databricks and Snowflake ETL processes for NCP transaction data (bronze to silver layer). We've made significant progress but are stuck on Level 4 validation (conditional copies logic).

## Current Status
- ✅ **Level 1-2 Complete**: Schema validation (173 columns) + Row count parity (12,686,818 rows exactly)
- ✅ **Level 3 Complete**: Status flags validation (millions of records populated correctly)
- ❌ **Level 4 STUCK**: Conditional copies showing 0 instead of expected 1,571,569 records

## Key Files to Review
1. **Main ETL**: `snowflake/refactored_scripts/enhanced_working_etl.sql` (ready to execute)
2. **Validation Framework**: `snowflake/validation/test_143_column_parity.sql` (10-level progressive validation)
3. **Debug Tools**: `snowflake/validation/debug_conditional_copies_detailed.sql` (comprehensive analysis)
4. **Project Context**: `CLAUDE.md` (complete handoff documentation)
5. **Validation Results**: `snowflake/validation/results/results1.txt` + `results2.txt`

## Immediate Issue
Level 4 validation expects:
- `auth3d_conditional_copies`: 1,571,569 (actual: 0)
- `auth3d_decision_copies`: 1,571,569 (actual: 0)

The conditional copy columns (`is_sale_3d_auth_3d`, `manage_3d_decision_auth_3d`) should be populated only for `auth3d` transactions but are showing 0.

## What I've Tried
1. Fixed case sensitivity (`AUTH3D` → `auth3d`)
2. Fixed CTE structure (moved conditional logic to status_flags_calculated CTE)
3. Removed duplicate column calculations
4. Fixed SQL syntax issues ("Missing column specification")

## Next Steps Needed
1. **Run debug script**: Execute `snowflake/validation/debug_conditional_copies_detailed.sql` to identify where conditional copies are lost
2. **Analyze results**: Check if issue is in data filtering, ETL logic, or column selection
3. **Fix root cause**: Based on debug results, correct the conditional logic
4. **Continue validation**: Progress through Level 5-10 once Level 4 passes

## Technical Details
- **Database**: POC.PUBLIC
- **Source**: NCP_BRONZE_V2 
- **Target**: NCP_SILVER_V2
- **Date Filter**: 2025-09-05
- **Expected auth3d transactions**: ~1.57M with conditional copies populated

## Validation Command
```sql
-- Level 4 validation query
SELECT 'SF - Conditional Copies Validation' AS test_type,
       COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'auth3d' AND is_sale_3d_auth_3d IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) AS auth3d_conditional_copies,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'auth3d' AND manage_3d_decision_auth_3d IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) AS auth3d_decision_copies,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN transaction_type != 'auth3d' AND is_sale_3d_auth_3d IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS non_auth3d_null_copies
FROM POC.PUBLIC.NCP_SILVER_V2;
```

Please start by running the debug script to identify the root cause of the conditional copies issue.
