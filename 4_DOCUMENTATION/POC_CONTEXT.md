# Nuvei DWH Platform POC - Business Context & Technical Requirements

## üè¢ BUSINESS CONTEXT - CRITICAL FOR SUCCESS

### **Company Overview:**
**Nuvei** - Global payment technology company with aggressive acquisition strategy. Currently consolidating databases from 6+ acquired companies into unified data warehouse platform (Snowflake vs Databricks decision pending).

### **üéØ POC PURPOSE:**
**Executive Decision:** Choose between Snowflake vs Databricks as Nuvei's global enterprise data warehouse platform for post-acquisition database consolidation.

### **üìä ACQUIRED COMPANIES & DATA PRIORITIES:**

#### **üî¥ CRITICAL PRIORITY:**
- **Paymentez**: 65 employees, UNKNOWN database stack - highest risk/priority for migration
- **Mazooma**: 6 employees, DB2 legacy systems - HIGH RISK (only 6 people with knowledge)

#### **üü° HIGH PRIORITY:**
- **Simplex**: 61 employees, already on Snowflake, crypto payments expertise
- **SafeCharge**: Large team, SQL Server + SingleStore, $889M acquisition

#### **üü¢ MODERATE:**
- **Additional acquired companies** with various database technologies

### **üìà ORGANIZATIONAL INTELLIGENCE:**
- **132 database professionals** identified across all acquired companies
- **Team ownership mapping** completed - know who owns which databases
- **Migration complexity assessment** done - understand technical debt
- **Executive dashboard** requirements established

### **üèóÔ∏è CURRENT TECHNICAL LANDSCAPE:**
- **25+ different database technologies** across acquired companies
- **Legacy systems**: DB2, SQL Server, SingleStore, various cloud platforms
- **Modern stack**: Some teams already on Snowflake (Simplex)
- **Compliance requirements**: Financial services, PCI DSS, international regulations

### **üí∞ BUSINESS DRIVERS:**
- **Cost optimization** - Consolidate licensing and operational overhead

- **M&A acceleration** - Faster integration of future acquisitions
- **AI/ML enablement** - Advanced analytics capabilities

## üîß TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR POC

### **Platform Evaluation Criteria:**
1. **Performance**: Query speed, data loading, concurrent users
2. **Cost**: Compute, storage, licensing, operational overhead
3. **Ease of migration**: From existing DB2, SQL Server, etc.
4. **Team adoption**: Learning curve for 132 database professionals
5. **Compliance**: Financial services requirements
6. **Scalability**: Handle future acquisitions
7. **AI/ML capabilities**: Advanced analytics readiness

### **Test Scenarios Required:**
- **Large-scale ETL** from legacy systems (DB2 ‚Üí DWH)
- **Real-time data ingestion** from payment processing systems
- **Complex analytics queries** for financial reporting
- **Multi-tenant data isolation** for different acquired companies
- **Compliance reporting** and audit trail generation

### **Success Metrics:**
- **Identical results** between Snowflake and Databricks implementations
- **Performance benchmarks** documented with actual numbers
- **Cost analysis** based on realistic workloads
- **Migration complexity assessment** for each acquired company
- **Executive-ready comparison report** with clear recommendation

## üìã POC IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### **Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup**
- Connect to both Snowflake and Databricks test environments
- Set up identical schemas and sample data
- Create connection templates and configuration management

### **Phase 2: ETL Migration**
- Extract existing Databricks ETL scripts and utilities
- Refactor all logic to Snowflake equivalents
- Maintain identical business logic and transformations

### **Phase 3: Validation & Testing**
- Create comprehensive data validation framework
- Run identical queries on both platforms
- Compare results with automated testing suite

### **Phase 4: Performance & Cost Analysis**
- Benchmark query performance across different workload types
- Measure resource consumption and costs
- Document operational complexity differences

### **Phase 5: Executive Reporting**
- Generate side-by-side comparison reports
- Include recommendations based on Nuvei's specific needs
- Present findings with business impact analysis

## üîê SECURITY & COMPLIANCE NOTES

### **Data Handling:**
- Use anonymized/synthetic data for POC when possible
- Follow Nuvei's data classification policies
- Implement proper access controls and audit logging

### **Credential Management:**
- Use secure credential storage (never commit secrets)
- Implement role-based access patterns
- Document security configurations for both platforms

## üìö REFERENCE MATERIALS

### **Existing Discovery Project:**
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/ArielS-Simplex/Nuvei-Work-Template
- **Database inventory** and team ownership mapping completed
- **Organizational intelligence** about acquired companies
- **Technical debt assessment** for each database stack

### **Key Stakeholders:**
- Database teams from each acquired company (132 professionals)
- Executive team making platform decision
- Compliance and security teams
- Finance team (cost impact analysis)

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### **Technical Success:**
- ‚úÖ 100% identical results between platforms for all test scenarios
- ‚úÖ Performance benchmarks documented with real numbers
- ‚úÖ Migration complexity assessed for each acquired company database
- ‚úÖ Automated validation suite proving data consistency

### **Business Success:**
